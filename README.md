On behalf of the [JNation](https://jnation.pt) organizers, it's my genuine pleasure to be your instructor today. My name is [Ricardo Ferreira](https://github.com/riferrei), and I lead the developer relations team at [Redis](https://redis.io).

In this workshop, you will learn how to design and develop an application that makes use of vector databases to handle semantic search. You will learn how to prepare the dataset for storage, how to process JSON documents and generate embeddings, how to index them into Redis, and how to implement searches and aggregations on top of it. You must be comfortable with [Java](https://www.java.com/en) and have a basic understanding of [Redis](https://redis.io/open-source).

## Part 1: Getting the application ready

TBD.

### Task 2: Building and running the application

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **20 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 3: Importing the dataset into Redis

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **5 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 4: Finding and removing duplicated movies

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **10 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 5: Fixing data glitches in the dataset

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **10 minutes**

TBD.

## Part 2: Processing the embeddings

### Task 1: Persistence layer for the existing data

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **10 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 2: Persistence layer for the generated data

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **10 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 3: Implementing the embedding generation

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **40 minutes**

TBD.

## Part 3: Implementing the Searches

### Task 1: Implementing the Full-Text Search

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **15 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 2: Implementing the Vector Similarity Search

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **30 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 3: Optimizing the Vector Similarity Search

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **15 minutes**

TBD.

## Part 4: Moving the dataset to the cloud

### Task 1: Create an account on Redis Cloud

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **5 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 2: Create an 30MB free database

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **5 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 3: Replicate the entire dataset

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **10 minutes**

TBD.

### Task 4: Point the application to the cloud

#### ‚è∞ Estimated time: **10 minutes**

TBD.
